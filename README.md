# Boilerplate Ruby C++ Extension

If you prefer C checkout the [C boilerplate](https://github.com/ChillerDragon/boilerplate-ruby-c-extension).

You need ``make``, ``ruby`` and a C++ compiler installed.

    gem install rice
    ruby extconf.rb
    make
    ruby main.rb

Also make sure to checkout the official documentation:
